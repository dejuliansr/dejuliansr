# üë®‚Äçüíª About Me:
Hello World! I am Demetrio Julian, a Junior Front-End Developer passionate about developing creative and efficient web solutions. I have foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with experience using frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Nuxt.js. I am particularly interested in front-end development and continuously strive to improve my skills in creating responsive, interactive, and user-friendly designs. Additionally, in the near future, I plan to learn and explore back-end development to expand my ability to build more complex web applications. Beyond my interest in web development, I have also been actively involved in robotics research labs and participated in robotics competitions. These experiences have strengthened my ability to think critically and solve technical problems creatively. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and listening to music, which helps me relax and find new inspiration in the creative world. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to work on exciting projects that will allow me to sharpen my programming skills and contribute to meaningful digital solutions. Let‚Äôs connect and create amazing things together in the world of web development!
